This is the most basic project using Node.js and Express.js is a simple REST API.

this is a build a book directory, using the four most basic methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

The GET is used for getting all books or getting only one book by id. With the POST method, you can add a new book to the list. With the PUT method, you can  update the existing book, and it’s evident that with the DELETE method, you will remove the book from the list.
